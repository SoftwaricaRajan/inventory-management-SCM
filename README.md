# Inventory Management and Supply Chain Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing inventory management through data analytics within the context of supply chain management. The main goal is to predict demand for products and optimize inventory levels using machine learning techniques. This project is part of a case study in supply chain management.

## Project Structure

- **scm.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, modeling, and results of the project. This notebook outlines the steps taken to build and evaluate the models for demand forecasting and inventory optimization.
  
- **train.csv**: The training dataset used to build and train the machine learning models. This dataset contains historical data on product sales and related features.

- **test.csv**: The test dataset used to evaluate the performance of the models. This dataset contains similar features as the training data but without the target variable.

- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample submission file showing the expected format for predictions. This file is used for submitting the final predictions after applying the model to the test data.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The objective of this project is to optimize inventory management by predicting the future demand for products. The key tasks include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data, identifying patterns, and extracting insights.
3. **Modeling**: Building and evaluating various machine learning models to predict product demand.
4. **Inventory Optimization**: Using predictive models to optimize inventory levels and improve supply chain efficiency.

### Key Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for developing and running code.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building models.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
